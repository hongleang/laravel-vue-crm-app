# Personal CRM Project ‚Äì Laravel & Vue 3

This is a **personal portfolio project** designed to showcase my skills in **Laravel (backend)** and **Vue 3 (frontend)**. It simulates a **modern Customer Relationship Management (CRM)** system with features like contact and company management, task tracking, and team role management.

## Key Highlights
- Role-based access control using Spatie Permissions
- Manage companies and contacts with detailed records, notes, and files
- Task assignment with filters and due-date tracking
- User and team management with role assignments
- Dashboard showing summary stats and recent activity

This project is intended to demonstrate my ability to:
- Build a scalable RESTful API with Laravel
- Architect a decoupled Vue 3 frontend with Pinia, Vue Router, and Axios
- Implement secure authentication and authorization with Laravel Sanctum
- Apply best practices in code structure, modularity, and reusable components
- Explore advanced features like real-time updates and queue-based processing (future enhancements)
